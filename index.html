            <p>Space Crash is an action-packed game where players control a spaceship at 
                the bottom of the screen, dodging falling stars to survive as long as 
                possible. As the game progresses, the stars fall faster, increasing the 
                challenge. Players can move the spaceship left and right using arrow keys, 
                with the objective of avoiding collisions to keep the game going. The game 
                features a simple yet vibrant space-themed design, dynamic difficulty, and 
                a timer to track survival time, offering an addictive and engaging experience 
                for players of all ages.
